# Book Scheduler App

This is a React application that allows users to schedule their reading. It uses the `react-big-calendar` library to display a calendar and Material-UI for the user interface.

## Components

The application consists of two main components:

1. `CalendarComponent`: This component displays a calendar with the scheduled books. It uses the `react-big-calendar` library.

2. `BookSchedule`: This component allows users to add new books to the schedule and displays a list of existing scheduled books.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies with `npm install`.

3. Start the development server with `npm start`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
